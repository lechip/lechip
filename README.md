### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Virtual Choreography](https://www.virtualchoreography.com/) as a hobby
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and a lot of [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any open source projects specially with Vue.js involved.
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for like minded devs that would like me to provide with mentoring about web technologies and Software Engineering.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about why I use Vue.js for hobbies and Ract at my work
