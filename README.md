### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Virtual Choreography](https://www.virtualchoreography.com/) as a hobby
- 🌱 I’m currently learning [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org/) and a lot of [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any open source projects specially with Vue.js involved.
- 🤔 I’m looking for like minded devs that would like me to provide with mentoring about web technologies and Software Engineering.
- 💬 Ask me about why I use Vue.js for hobbies and React at my work
- 📫 How to reach me: [@lechip](https://twitter.com/lechip)
- ⚡ Silly fact: I keep all my notes in "perfectly" linted markdown 🤖
